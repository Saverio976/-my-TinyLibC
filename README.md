(my)TinyLibC

just write some basic function (and why not, some non basic)

## DOC

use doxygen (doxygen doc at https://saverio976.github.io/-my-TinyLibC)
- doc available at https://saverio976.github.io/-my-TinyLibC
- each function have doc with the (auto)completion of your IDE

## Build

```bash
make
```

You will have a `tinylibc.a` archive file

object are compiled to `obj` folder (and makefile dont relink !!!) (i'm proud of that xD)
